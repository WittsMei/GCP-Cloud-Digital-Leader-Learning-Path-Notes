## Databases, Data Warehouses, and Data Lakes

### üß† Combined Architectures in the Modern Data Stack ###
In modern data architectures, organizations typically combine Databases, Data Warehouses, and Data Lakes to support operational efficiency, business intelligence, and advanced analytics such as machine learning.

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Databases ‚Äì Real-Time Operational Layer**
- Store structured, transactional data generated by operational systems (e.g., apps, websites, CRMs).

- Designed for OLTP (Online Transaction Processing).

- Optimized for fast reads/writes, ACID compliance, and real-time performance.

- Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Cloud SQL, AWS RDS

**2Ô∏è‚É£ ETL / ELT Tools ‚Äì Data Movement & Transformation Layer**
- Extract data from databases and load into downstream systems.

- Perform transformations either: Before loading (ETL ‚Äì Extract, Transform, Load), or After loading (ELT ‚Äì Extract, Load, Transform).

- Enable data quality checks, lineage tracking, and orchestration.

- Examples: Apache Airflow, dbt, Fivetran, Airbyte, Talend

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Warehouses ‚Äì Business Intelligence Layer**
- Centralize structured, cleaned, and joined data optimized for analytics.

- Enable dashboards, KPI tracking, and trend analysis through OLAP (Online Analytical Processing).

- Store both current and historical data for time-series analysis and forecasting.

- Examples: Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Azure Synapse

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Lakes ‚Äì Raw Data and Advanced Analytics Layer**
- Store all data ‚Äî structured, semi-structured, and unstructured ‚Äî in its native/raw form.

- Cost-effective and scalable for massive datasets.

- Ideal for data science, machine learning, and data exploration.

- Use schema-on-read instead of strict upfront schema definitions.

- Examples: AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, Google Cloud Storage

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Query Engines over Data Lakes**
- Provide SQL-based querying capabilities directly on data lake files without the need for data movement.

- Bridge the gap between raw storage and actionable insights.

- Common in serverless or ad hoc analytics scenarios.

- Examples: Presto, Trino, Amazon Athena, Google BigLake, Databricks SQL
