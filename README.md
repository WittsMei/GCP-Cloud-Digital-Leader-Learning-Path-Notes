## Databases, Data Warehouses, and Data Lakes

### ðŸ§  Combined Architectures in the Modern Data Stack ###
In modern data architectures, organizations typically combine Databases, Data Warehouses, and Data Lakes to support operational efficiency, business intelligence, and advanced analytics such as machine learning.

- **Databases** store real-time operational data.

- ETL tools (e.g., Apache Airflow, dbt, Fivetran) extract data to:

- **Data Warehouses** for dashboards and KPIs, which can store both current and historical data.

- Raw data is stored in **Data Lakes**, which can be queried directly using engines like Presto, Athena, or Databricks.
